  Use when implementing UI from Figma designs with pixel-perfect fidelity.
  Covers the complete Figma-to-code pipeline: extracting design specs via
  Figma MCP tools (get_design_context, get_screenshot, get_variable_defs),
  translating every visual property to exact CSS (fonts, colors, spacing,
  shadows, gradients, border-radius, opacity), building design token systems,
  mapping Auto Layout to Flexbox/Grid, converting component variants to
  props, and verifying implementation against Figma screenshots.

  Requires: Figma desktop MCP (figma-desktop) for design extraction.

  Synthesizes Figma Dev Mode API (2024-2025), CSS Specifications (Color L4,
  Flexbox, Grid, Container Queries), WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, Google
  Fonts Best Practices, and Playwright Visual Testing.

  Trigger phrases: "implement this Figma", "Figma to code", "pixel perfect",
  "match the design", "copy the Figma", "design implementation",

# Figma to Code — Pixel-Perfect Implementation

## Core Principles

1. **Extract, never guess** — Every value comes from Figma MCP tools or the
   screenshot. Never approximate colors, spacing, or font sizes.
2. **Validate visually, always** — Take a Figma screenshot AND a browser
   screenshot. Compare side-by-side. Code is not done until they match.
3. **Tokens over hardcodes** — Extract repeated values into CSS custom
   properties. One source of truth for colors, spacing, typography.
4. **Component by component** — Never extract an entire screen at once.
   Work top-down: page → sections → individual components.
5. **Project conventions first** — Use the project's existing design system,
   component library, and naming patterns. Only create new when nothing fits.
6. **Preserve Figma naming and layers** — Keep component layer hierarchy and
   token/variable names aligned with Figma whenever possible.

## Quick-Start: The 6-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Design Context

```
get_design_context(nodeId="1:2", clientFrameworks="react", clientLanguages="typescript,css")
```

Parse Figma URL: `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2` → nodeId `1:2`.
If branch URL, use branchKey as fileKey.

### Step 2: Capture Screenshot

```
get_screenshot(nodeId="1:2")
```

ALWAYS capture. This is your ground truth for visual validation.

### Step 3: Extract Design Tokens

```
get_variable_defs(nodeId="1:2")
```

Map returned tokens to CSS custom properties. See `references/design-tokens.md`.

### Step 4: Translate to Code

Convert MCP output to project conventions:
- Replace generated classes with project's design system tokens
- Use existing components where they match
- Apply exact CSS values from Figma (see reference files for conversion tables)
- Preserve Figma layer structure for each component (wrapper/content/icon/text
  relationships should match the Figma node tree)
- Keep token names close to Figma variable names; if renamed, record a mapping
  and explicitly note that Figma names must be updated too if parity is desired

### Step 5: Apply Pixel-Perfect CSS

Address the critical rendering differences:

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Text looks bolder in browser | `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` globally |
| Spacing off by 1-2px | Use exact Figma values, avoid rounding |
| Colors look different | Check opacity stacking, use sRGB profile |
| Shadow too strong | Figma blur = diameter, CSS = radius — divide by 2 |
| Gradient direction wrong | Add 90° to Figma angle |
| Font weight mismatch | Figma 500 ≈ browser 400 due to rendering |

### Step 6: Validate Parity

Compare Figma screenshot against browser screenshot. Check every item on
the fidelity checklist in `references/visual-verification.md`. Iterate
until match is exact.

## Decision Trees

### What to Extract First

| Design Scope | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| Full page | get_metadata first → identify sections → extract each component |
| Single component | get_design_context directly on component node |
| Design system | get_variable_defs → then each component variant |
| Complex/large screen | Metadata-only + screenshot → component-by-component extraction |

### Token Limit Management

| MCP Response Size | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| < 50k tokens | Use get_design_context output directly |
| 50-100k tokens | Extract component-by-component, not full frame |
| > 100k tokens | Use get_metadata for structure, screenshot for details |

### CSS Property Quick-Reference

| Figma Property | CSS Property | Gotcha |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| Auto Layout horizontal | `display: flex; flex-direction: row` | — |
| Auto Layout vertical | `display: flex; flex-direction: column` | — |
| Item spacing | `gap` | Not margin between children |
| Fill container | `flex: 1` | Only inside Auto Layout parent |
| Hug contents | `width: fit-content` | — |
| Fixed size | `width: Npx; height: Npx` | — |
| lineHeightPercentFontSize: 150 | `line-height: 1.5` | Unitless, divide by 100 |
| letterSpacing (%) | `letter-spacing: Nem` | Divide % by 100 |
| RGBA {r:0-1} | `rgba(r*255, g*255, b*255, a)` | Multiply RGB by 255 |
| Gradient angle 0° | `linear-gradient(90deg, ...)` | Add 90° |
| Blur radius 8 | `filter: blur(4px)` | Divide by 2 |
| DROP_SHADOW | `box-shadow` | No inset keyword |
| INNER_SHADOW | `box-shadow: inset ...` | Add inset keyword |
| Stroke INSIDE | `box-sizing: border-box; border: ...` | — |
| Stroke OUTSIDE | `outline: ...` | Not border |

## Anti-Patterns

- Selecting entire screens in one extraction (token overflow)
- Skipping screenshot validation ("the code looks right")
- Hardcoding values instead of using design tokens
- Importing icon packages instead of using Figma SVG exports
- Treating MCP-generated code as final (it needs project adaptation)
- Creating new components when project already has matching ones
- Approximating colors/spacing instead of using exact Figma values
- Renaming tokens/layers silently without a documented Figma-to-code mapping
