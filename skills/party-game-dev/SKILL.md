  Build real-time multiplayer party games (Jackbox-style) with full-stack
  TypeScript. Covers host-player architecture (TV + phones), Socket.IO
  networking, game state machines, room/lobby management, voting and scoring
  systems, and BDD testing for multiplayer scenarios with multiple browser
  contexts. Synthesizes patterns from Jackbox Games reverse engineering,
  Drawphone, Rocketcrab, Fishbowl OSS implementations, Socket.IO
  documentation, and Playwright multi-context testing patterns.

# Party Game Development

Build Jackbox-style party games: one shared screen (TV/projector) runs the
host display, each player uses their phone as a controller. All connected
via WebSockets with server-authoritative state.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Server owns the truth** — All game state lives on the server. Clients
   send inputs, server validates, broadcasts results. No cheating possible.
2. **Rooms are ephemeral** — In-memory state, 4-character room codes, auto-cleanup.
   No database needed for the game itself.
3. **Phones are dumb controllers** — Player devices submit inputs and render
   state. Zero game logic on the client.
4. **Test with real players** — BDD tests spawn multiple browser contexts.
   No mocks. Real WebSocket connections. Real game flow.
5. **Ship the simplest game first** — Prompt-response (Quiplash pattern) is
   the easiest to build. Start there, add complexity later.

## Quick-Start

### "I want to build a party game from scratch"

| Step | Action | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Choose game type (prompt-response recommended for first game) | `references/game-types-and-mechanics.md` |
| 2 | Scaffold project structure (monorepo: server + host + player) | `references/game-architecture.md` |
| 3 | Set up Socket.IO server with room management | `references/multiplayer-networking.md` |
| 4 | Implement game state machine (phases, rounds, timers) | `references/game-state-machines.md` |
| 5 | Build host screen (TV display) and player controller (phone) | `references/frontend-patterns.md` |
| 6 | Write BDD tests with multiple browser contexts | `references/bdd-multiplayer-testing.md` |
| 7 | Deploy with WebSocket support | `references/deployment-and-ops.md` |

### "I want to add a new game type to an existing project"

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Pick game type blueprint from `references/game-types-and-mechanics.md` |
| 2 | Define data models (prompts, answers, votes, scores) |
| 3 | Implement round loop phases in game state machine |
| 4 | Build game-specific UI components for host and player screens |
| 5 | Write BDD feature files for the new game flow |

### "I need to test multiplayer interactions"

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Set up playwright-bdd with `.bdd/` directory structure |
| 2 | Create multi-player fixtures (2-8 browser contexts) |
| 3 | Write Gherkin with persona-based steps (`Given Player "Alice"...`) |
| 4 | Implement page objects: `LobbyPage`, `GamePage`, `ResultsPage` |
| 5 | Use `Promise.all()` for cross-player assertions |
| 6 | Adapt `assets/test-multiplayer-example.ts` for quick Socket.IO smoke tests |

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Lobby
Build room creation, room codes, player joining, player list display.
Test: 3 players can join a room and see each other.

### Phase 2: Game Loop
Implement phase transitions: Lobby -> Round Start -> Input -> Reveal -> Score.
Test: A complete round flows from prompt to scoring.

### Phase 3: Player Interaction
Add answer submission, voting, timer countdown.
Test: Players submit answers, vote, scores update correctly.

### Phase 4: Polish
Animations, sound effects, edge cases (disconnect/reconnect, host migration).
Test: Player disconnects and reconnects mid-game.

### Phase 5: Deploy
Docker + Fly.io (or Railway). Redis adapter if scaling beyond one server.

## Decision Trees

### Which Game Type to Build First?

| If you want... | Build | Complexity |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| Easiest to implement | Prompt-response (Quiplash) | Low |
| Visual/creative | Drawing game (Drawful) | Medium |
| Knowledge-based | Trivia/quiz | Medium |
| Social deduction | Word association / Wavelength | High |

### Tech Stack

| Component | Default Choice | Alternative |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Server | Express + Socket.IO | Fastify + Socket.IO |
| Frontend | React + Vite | Svelte, Vue |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | CSS Modules |
| Animation | Framer Motion | CSS transitions |
| State machine | Plain TypeScript | XState (complex games) |
| Testing | playwright-bdd | @cucumber/cucumber + Playwright |
| Hosting | Fly.io | Railway, Render |

### When to Add a Database?

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Game state during play | In-memory only |
| Player accounts / history | Add PostgreSQL |
| Leaderboards across sessions | Add PostgreSQL |
| Custom prompt packs | JSON files or PostgreSQL |
| Analytics / game stats | Add PostgreSQL |

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Client-side game logic | Server-authoritative state | Prevents cheating |
| Polling for game state | WebSocket push | Real-time updates |
| Shared browser context in tests | Separate `BrowserContext` per player | Isolated sessions |
| Fixed delays in tests | `waitForSelector` / event-based waits | Reliable timing |
| Database for live game state | In-memory Map/Object | Speed, simplicity |
| Mocking WebSocket in tests | Real Socket.IO connections | Tests what ships |
| Complex room code schemes | 4-char alphanumeric (exclude 0/O/1/I) | Easy to read aloud |

## Assets (Examples)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `assets/test-multiplayer-example.ts` | Example: spawn N Socket.IO clients, simulate a game round. Adapt to your event names. |
| `assets/lobby.feature` | Example: Gherkin feature for lobby creation and joining |
| `assets/game-round.feature` | Example: Gherkin feature for a complete game round |
| `assets/edge-cases.feature` | Example: Gherkin feature for disconnect/reconnect scenarios |
