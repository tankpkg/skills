  Expert management of GitHub Issues via the gh CLI and GitHub platform.
  Covers the full issue lifecycle: creating, triaging, editing, closing,
  and linking issues to PRs. Includes issue templates (classic .md and
  modern YAML forms), search and filtering, label taxonomy design,
  milestones, Projects v2 integration, gh api scripting for bulk
  operations, GitHub Actions automation (stale, labeler, auto-assign,
  welcome bot), and issue-driven development workflows. Synthesizes
  GitHub CLI documentation, GitHub REST/GraphQL API reference, GitHub
  Actions marketplace, and production OSS issue management patterns.

  Trigger phrases: "github issue", "gh issue", "create issue",
  "close issue", "issue template", "issue form", "ISSUE_TEMPLATE",
  "triage issue", "label issue", "milestone", "stale issues",
  "bulk close issues", "search issues", "gh search issues",
  "issue automation", "config.yml blank issues", "issue-driven",
  "sub-issues", "gh issue develop", "gh label", "issue workflow",
  "gh api issues", "bulk operations issues", "issue forms yaml",

# GitHub Issues

## Core Philosophy

1. **Issues are the unit of work** -- Every code change traces back to an
   issue. No issue, no PR. This creates accountability and traceability.
2. **Triage within 48 hours** -- Every new issue gets classified, labeled,
   and either accepted, closed, or flagged for more info within 2 days.
3. **Structure beats freedom** -- Use Issue Forms (.yml) over classic
   templates. Enforce required fields. Disable blank issues. Structured
   input produces actionable issues.
4. **Automate the boring parts** -- Labeling, staleness, assignment, and
   project routing belong in GitHub Actions, not human checklists.
5. **gh CLI is the primary interface** -- Every issue operation is faster
   from the terminal. Master `gh issue`, `gh search issues`, and `gh api`.

## Quick-Start: What Do You Need?

| Task | Start Here |
|------|-----------|
| Create, view, edit, close an issue | See `references/gh-issue-commands.md` |
| Find issues matching specific criteria | See `references/search-and-filter.md` |
| Set up issue templates for a repo | See `references/issue-templates.md` |
| Design label taxonomy, manage milestones/projects | See `references/labels-milestones-projects.md` |
| Bulk operations, API scripting, CSV export | See `references/api-and-scripting.md` |
| Set up GitHub Actions for issue automation | See `references/automation-actions.md` |
| Issue-driven development, triage, linking patterns | See `references/workflows-and-patterns.md` |

## Command Routing Table

| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| List open issues | `gh issue list` |
| List with filters | `gh issue list -l bug -a @me -s open` |
| Create an issue | `gh issue create -t "Title" -b "Body" -l bug` |
| View issue details | `gh issue view 123` |
| Edit issue metadata | `gh issue edit 123 --add-label "priority/high"` |
| Close with reason | `gh issue close 123 -r completed -c "Fixed in #456"` |
| Reopen an issue | `gh issue reopen 123` |
| Comment on issue | `gh issue comment 123 -b "Thanks for reporting"` |
| Create branch from issue | `gh issue develop 123 --checkout` |
| Search across repos | `gh search issues "bug" --owner myorg --state open` |
| Transfer to another repo | `gh issue transfer 123 owner/other-repo` |
| Pin important issue | `gh issue pin 123` |
| Lock conversation | `gh issue lock 123 -r resolved` |
| Delete issue | `gh issue delete 123 --yes` |
| Bulk close by label | `gh issue list -l stale --json number -q '.[].number' \| xargs -I{} gh issue close {}` |

## Decision Trees

### Issue Template Format

| Signal | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Need structured fields with validation | Issue Form (.yml) |
| Need free-form markdown body | Classic template (.md) |
| Need to enforce required fields | Issue Form (.yml) |
| Need code input with syntax highlighting | Issue Form with `render` attribute |
| Migrating from existing .md templates | Convert to .yml for better UX |

### Close or Keep Open?

| Signal | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| Fixed by merged PR | Close with `--reason completed` |
| Won't implement, by design | Close with `--reason "not planned"` |
| Duplicate of existing issue | Close, comment with link to original |
| Can't reproduce, no response in 14 days | Close with `--reason "not planned"` |
| Needs more info, reporter active | Keep open, add `status/needs-info` label |
| Valid but low priority | Keep open, add to Backlog milestone |
| Security vulnerability | Do NOT use public issue. Use security advisory. |

### When to Use Sub-Issues vs Task Lists

| Signal | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Multiple distinct work items, separate assignees | Sub-issues |
| Simple checklist within one person's work | Task list (markdown checkboxes) |
| Cross-repo breakdown of an epic | Sub-issues (same org) |
| Progress tracking visible in Projects | Sub-issues |
| Quick TODO within an issue body | Task list |

## Issue Lifecycle Keywords

Auto-close an issue when a PR merges to the default branch:

```
Fixes #42        Closes #42        Resolves #42
fixes #42        closes #42        resolves #42
Fixed #42        Closed #42        Resolved #42
```

Multiple issues: `Fixes #42, closes #43, resolves #100`

Cross-repo: `Fixes owner/other-repo#42`

## Anti-Patterns

| Do Not | Do Instead |
|--------|-----------|
| Report security bugs as public issues | Use private vulnerability reporting |
| Close issues without explanation | Always add closing comment with reason |
| Create labels without descriptions | Add description to every label |
| Assign 5+ people to one issue | Max 1-2 assignees; mention teams in comments |
| Use blank issues when templates exist | Set `blank_issues_enabled: false` in config.yml |
| Manually add issues to projects | Use auto-add project workflows |
| Create one giant issue for a feature | Break into sub-issues with parent epic |
| Use closing keywords in non-default branch PRs | Keywords only auto-close from default branch |
